Fluent Bit recently surpassed 10 billion pulls from Docker Hub. That's
*billion*, with a "B." üéâ

As the creators and maintainers of [Fluent
Bit](https://fluentbit.io/), we at Calyptia are stunned
and humbled by its success.

Released in 2017, Fluent Bit surpassed one billion Docker pulls in March
2022.¬† Since then, the pulls have accelerated rapidly, adding an
additional nine billion in eighteen months.¬†

To help put those numbers in perspective:

-   Fluent Bit has added over five billion pulls in 2023 so far

-   It is currently averaging over 23 million pulls per day

-   That's 270 pulls every second, 24/7

## Wait, how is that possible?

First, you can see the exact count using the [Docker
API](https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/fluent/fluent-bit/)---look
for the pull_count key. Next, 10 billion Docker pulls does not mean that
10 billion developers have downloaded Fluent Bit from Docker. Most of
those pulls will be automated as organizations scale up their
infrastructure to meet demand. It's easy for large companies with
complex infrastructures to rack up thousands of pulls in a day under
some conditions.¬†¬†

Amazingly, the numbers we can track using the Docker API don't tell the
entire story. They do not, for example, include private repositories
where organizations clone and store the official image, which is how
most large enterprises enforce version control. Also not counted in the
above are the instances when Fluent Bit is deployed "behind the scenes"
as part of a cloud provider's service, as it is by AWS, Google, and
Azure. So the real numbers are undoubtedly higher, probably
significantly higher. But what's a few billion pulls, give or take?

## Why is Fluent Bit so Popular?¬†

-   **Designed for Cloud-Native:** Microservices are now the defacto
    architecture for delivering cloud-native applications.¬† With its
    small memory and CPU utilization footprint, Fluent Bit was created
    with those environments specifically in mind.¬†

-   **Built for Kubernetes and Containers:**¬† Despite its low resource
    utilization, Fluent Bit has proven its ability to [process large
    amounts of data
    efficiently](https://calyptia.com/blog/benchmarking-fluent-bit).
    Because of its performance at scale, Fluent Bit is embedded in major
    Kubernetes distributions, including those from AWS, GCP, and Azure.

-   **Observability and Security Data is more important than ever:**
    ¬†Enterprises are increasingly storing and analyzing event data as
    part of their observability and security efforts to reduce
    application downtime and incident response time.

## A bit about Fluent Bit's history¬†

Fluent Bit is a [CNCF-Graduated
project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) under the
umbrella of Fluentd, alongside other foundational technologies such as
Kubernetes and Prometheus.¬† It was originally created to be a
lighter-weight version of Fluentd for collecting and forwarding logs
from Internet of Things (IoT) devices and containers where deploying
Fluentd would be impractical or even impossible due to limited system
resources. It has since evolved and is now capable of collecting logs,
metrics, and traces, processing them in mid-stream, and routing them to
any number of backends.

## How to manage all those Fluent Bit instances?

With so many Fluent Bit agents deployed across increasingly complex
architectures, enterprises may struggle with managing them all. To
address this need, Calyptia, the creators of Fluent Bit, has introduced
Fluent Bit fleet management into [Calyptia
Core,](https://calyptia.com/products/calyptia-core) our commercial product that simplifies
data management for your observability and SIEM pipelines. Fleet
management enables teams to configure and manage thousands of instances
of Fluent Bit across the enterprise from one central location,
significantly increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of
misconfiguration. To learn more, [book a demo](https://calyptia.com/demo).
